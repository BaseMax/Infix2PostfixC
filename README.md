# Infix To Postfix Converter

This is a simple program that converts infix expressions to postfix expressions. It is written in C and uses a stack to store the operators. It is a simple program that I wrote to show how to use a stack in C.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the program using `gcc -o Infix2Postfix Infix2Postfix.c`
3. Run the program using `./Infix2Postfix`

## Example

```
Enter an infix expression: (2+4)*6
The postfix expression is: 24+6*
```
